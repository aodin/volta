Volta
=====
A web framework in Go.

##What Volta Is
Volta is a suite of components necessary for building a modern web application.


##What It Isn't
Volta is not a complete, batteries included framework (ala Django or Rails). It does not include an ORM (object relational mapping) or even any database queries.

A number of interfaces have been created (see `User` or `Session` for examples) that can be implemented as any sort of persistance storage.
